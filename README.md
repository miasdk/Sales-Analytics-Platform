-- Transaction Data (100,000+ records)
orders                             order_items
â”œâ”€â”€ order_id (SERIAL PK)          â”œâ”€â”€ item_id (SERIAL PK)
â”œâ”€â”€ customer_id (FK, INDEXED)     â”œâ”€â”€ order_id (FK, INDEXED)
â”œâ”€â”€ order_date (INDEXED)          â”œâ”€â”€ product_id (FK, INDEXED)
â”œâ”€â”€ total_amount (DECIMAL)        â”œâ”€â”€ quantity (INTEGER)
â”œâ”€â”€ status (ENUM, INDEXED)        â”œâ”€â”€ unit_price (DECIMAL)
â””â”€â”€ payment_method                â””â”€â”€ total_price (DECIMAL)
```

### Analytics Views & Performance

```sql
-- Customer Summary View (RFM Analysis)
CREATE VIEW customer_summary AS
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    COUNT(o.order_id) as total_orders,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as total_spent,
    AVG(o.total_amount) as avg_order_value,
    MAX(o.order_date) as last_order_date,
    EXTRACT(DAYS FROM CURRENT_DATE - MAX(o.order_date)) as recency_days
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id;

-- Product Performance View
CREATE VIEW product_performance AS
SELECT 
    p.product_id,
    p.product_name,
    p.category,
    SUM(oi.quantity) as total_sold,
    SUM(oi.total_price) as total_revenue,
    SUM(oi.total_price - oi.quantity * p.cost) as total_profit
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name, p.category;
```
