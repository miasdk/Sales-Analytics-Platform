## Database Design

The database schema implements a normalized structure optimized for both transactional integrity and analytical performance. The design supports complex queries while maintaining data consistency through proper foreign key relationships and constraints.

```sql
-- Customer Management
customers (5,000 records)
├── customer_id (SERIAL PK)
├── email (UNIQUE, INDEXED)
├── registration_date (INDEXED)
├── country (INDEXED)
├── age_group (INDEXED)
└── customer_segment

-- Product Catalog
products (1,000 records)
├── product_id (SERIAL PK)
├── product_name (INDEXED)
├── category (INDEXED)
├── brand (INDEXED)
├── price (DECIMAL, INDEXED)
└── cost (DECIMAL)

-- Transaction Records
orders (50,000+ records)
├── order_id (SERIAL PK)
├── customer_id (FK, INDEXED)
├── order_date (INDEXED)
├── total_amount (DECIMAL)
├── status (ENUM, INDEXED)
└── payment_method

order_items (75,000+ records)
├── item_id (SERIAL PK)
├── order_id (FK, INDEXED)
├── product_id (FK, INDEXED)
├── quantity (INTEGER)
├── unit_price (DECIMAL)
└── total_price (DECIMAL)
```

**Performance Optimizations**
- B-tree indexes on frequently queried columns improving query execution performance
- Materialized views for complex analytical queries with scheduled refresh operations
- Connection pooling configuration for concurrent user support and resource optimization
- Query optimization through strategic JOIN ordering and WHERE clause positioning

**Analytics Views**
```sql
-- Customer behavior analysis
CREATE VIEW customer_summary AS
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    COUNT(o.order_id) as total_orders,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as total_spent,
    AVG(o.total_amount) as avg_order_value,
    MAX(o.order_date) as last_order_date,
    EXTRACT(DAYS FROM CURRENT_DATE - MAX(o.order_date)) as recency_days
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id;

-- Product performance metrics
CREATE VIEW product_performance AS
SELECT 
    p.product_id,
    p.product_name,
    p.category,
    SUM(oi.quantity) as total_sold,
    SUM(oi.total_price) as total_revenue,
    SUM(oi.total_price - oi.quantity * p.cost) as total_profit
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name, p.category;
```

## Machine Learning Models

The machine learning pipeline implements multiple algorithms with automated model selection based on performance metrics. Each model includes comprehensive validation procedures and business-relevant evaluation criteria.

**Sales Forecasting System**
Time series forecasting using ensemble methods with feature engineering for improved accuracy:

```python
# Model ensemble configuration
models = {
    'Random Forest': RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42),
    'Gradient Boosting': GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42),
    'Linear Regression': LinearRegression()
}

# Feature engineering pipeline
features = [
    'trend_component', 'seasonal_indicators', 'day_of_week_encoding',
    'month_encoding', 'quarter_encoding', 'revenue_lag_7', 'revenue_lag_30',
    'revenue_moving_avg_7', 'revenue_moving_avg_30'
]
```

**Performance Targets**
- Forecast accuracy optimization through cross-validation and model comparison
- 90-day prediction horizon with confidence interval estimation for business planning
- Automated model selection using multiple algorithms and validation techniques
- Feature importance analysis for understanding key revenue drivers

**Customer Analytics Models**

    'Loyal Customers': 'Consistent customers with strong engagement patterns',
    'Potential Loyalists': 'Recent customers showing growth potential',
    'At Risk': 'Previously valuable customers with declining activity',
    'Cannot Lose Them': 'High-value customers requiring retention focus',
    'Lost Customers': 'Inactive customers needing reactivation campaigns'
}
```
